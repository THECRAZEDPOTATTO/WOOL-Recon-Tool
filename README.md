# Wool-Recon-Tool
Wool is a basic recon made in python but can be dropped with C++ or Rust

## Why
After seening a lot of skidded Stealers/Grabbers renamed and little code edits made I decided it I would upload this and not make it paid. Their is no point in hiding open things to better recon and make it paid so becuase of this Wool will now be open source.

## About 
Wool uses Discord as a C2 and is a one way stealer meaning no rat [sad face] but it has other things not found in other grabbers such as 
```
- Epic Games Info Grabber
- Spotify info Grabber
- Paypal info Grabber
- Bitlocker Stealer
- Waits till Client is online before running
```
